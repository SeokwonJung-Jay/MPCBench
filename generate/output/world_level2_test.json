Actually, wait, I think there was an update last week. Let me check...\n\nSection 1: Work Hours\nEmployees should schedule meetings during standard work hours. The standard work hours are 9 AM to 6 PM. Actually, I think it might be 8:30 AM to 5:30 PM in some departments. Let me verify... No wait, it's definitely 9 to 6. Or is it 9:30? Hmm.\n\nSection 2: Lunch Breaks\nLunch breaks are from 12:00 PM to 1:00 PM. Do not schedule meetings during this time. Actually, some teams have lunch from 11:30 to 12:30, but the official policy is 12 to 1. I think.\n\nSection 3: Buffer Times\nThere should be a buffer between meetings. I think it's 10 minutes. Or maybe 15? Let me check the handbook... Actually, the system says 10 minutes minimum buffer. Yes, 10 minutes.\n\nSection 4: Restricted Times\nMonday mornings from 9 AM to 12 PM are restricted. Also Friday afternoons from 1 PM to 6 PM. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check... Yes, Monday 9-12 and Friday 1-6 are restricted.\n\nNote: This policy may be updated. Please refer to the latest version. Actually, I'm not sure if this is the latest version. Someone should update this document.\n\nAlso note: Some of the above information might be outdated. Please verify with HR.\n\nEND OF POLICY DOCUMENT",
