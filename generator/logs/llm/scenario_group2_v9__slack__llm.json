quick summary of this week’s progress on the Mobile App Launch (MOB):\\n\\n1) Performance Improvements\\n- We landed a round of optimizations on the mobile client around image handling and caching.\\n- In our latest benchmark runs on the dev branch, median app start time has improved by roughly 15% compared to last week’s baseline.\\n- Scroll performance on content-heavy views is also noticeably smoother on lower-end devices in our test set.\\n\\n2) User Growth Signals\\n- On the existing beta channel, we’ve seen early positive indicators from the last incremental rollout.\\n- Active beta users are up by a little over 10% week-over-week, and session length continues to trend up.\\n- Support tickets related to app responsiveness have ticked down slightly, which aligns with the performance gains.\\n\\n3) Next Steps\\n- We’ve scheduled a dedicated planning and performance deep-dive session with Engineering next week to finalize constraints and scope before the Planning milestone.\\n- After that session, we’ll update the MOB roadmap and confirm which items make the cut for the first public launch.\\n\\nThanks to everyone who contributed to this week’s work,
