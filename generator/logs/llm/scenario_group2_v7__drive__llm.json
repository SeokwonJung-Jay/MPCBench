Overview\\nThis week we saw solid improvements in both app performance and user engagement for the Mobile App Launch (MOB). No new high-severity incidents were reported, and we remain on track for upcoming planning and launch activities.\\n\\n2. Key Wins\\n- Performance: ~15% improvement in median app startup time vs. the previous 4-week baseline.\\n- Growth: ~10% week-over-week increase in weekly active users (WAU).\\n- Stability: No new Sev-1 or Sev-2 incidents; error rates remain within target thresholds.\\n\\n3. Performance Improvements (15% faster startup)\\n- Source: Internal dashboards (see \\\"MOB - Performance & Growth snapshot (Week of Nov 17, 2025)\\\" and attached PDF export).\\n- Metric: Median app startup time (50th percentile) across iOS and Android.\\n- Baseline: ~2300 ms (previous 4 weeks average).\\n- Current: ~1955 ms (week of Nov 17).\\n- Change: ~15% improvement.\\n- Primary drivers:\\n  - Image loading optimizations shipped early in the week.\\n  - Caching tweaks that reduced redundant network calls on app start.\\n\\n4. User Growth (10% WAU increase)\\n- Metric: Weekly active users (WAU) across all regions.\\n- Baseline: ~50,000 WAU.\\n- Current: ~55,000 WAU.\\n- Change: ~10% uplift week-over-week.\\n- Notes:\\n  - Early data suggests the new onboarding flow is contributing to higher activation rates, especially on Android.\\n  - We will continue to monitor retention cohorts over the next 2–3 weeks.\\n\\n5. Risks & Next Steps\\n- Risks:\\n  - Some open technical risks remain on MOB-101 (Core Feature) that could affect Development and Launch milestones.\\n  - We still need to fully align on scope and sequencing for the remaining work.\\n- Next Steps:\\n  - Conduct two back-to-back planning meetings on Wed 11/26:\\n    1) \\\"MOB - Mobile App status & risks (Alex + Jordan)\\\" (4:30–5:00pm ET)\\n    2) \\\"MOB - Mobile App Launch planning decisions (Sam & Taylor)\\\" (5:00–5:30pm ET)\\n  - Use outputs from those sessions to finalize scope and ownership in the \\\"MOB - Planning & Milestone Matrix\\\" sheet.\\n\\n6.
