quick summary of this week’s progress on the Mobile App Launch (MOB):\\n\\n1) Performance Improvements\\n- We landed a round of optimizations on the mobile client around image handling and caching.\\n- In our latest benchmark runs on the dev branch, median app start time has improved by roughly 15% compared to last week’s baseline.\\n- Scroll performance on content-heavy views is also noticeably smoother on lower-end devices in our test set.\\n\\n2) User Growth Signals\\n- On the existing beta channel, we’ve seen early positive indicators from the last incremental rollout.\\n- Active beta users are up by a little over 10% week-over-week, and session length continues to trend up.\\n- Support tickets related to app responsiveness have ticked down slightly, which aligns with the performance gains.\\n\\n3) Next Steps\\n- We’ve scheduled a dedicated planning and performance deep-dive session with Engineering next week to finalize constraints and scope before the Planning milestone.\\n- After that session, we’ll update the MOB roadmap and confirm which items make the cut for the first public launch.\\n\\nThanks to everyone who contributed to this week’s work,

improvements are realistic for the initial Mobile App Launch scope, and capture any hard constraints that affect Planning milestone commitments.\\n\\nProposed 45‑minute agenda\\n1) Context setting (5 min)\\n   - Quick recap of MOB roadmap and Planning milestone on 2025-11-10.\\n   - Highlight relationship between performance work (MOB-101) and launch readiness.\\n\\n2) Review dev-branch benchmarks (15 min)\\n   - Walk through key metrics from the dev perf sheet:\\n     - Median app start time improvement (~15%).\\n     - Scroll performance on content-heavy views.\\n     - Impact of new caching layer and image optimization.\\n   - Call out any outliers (e.g., low‑end devices, poor networks).\\n\\n3) Engineering constraints & trade‑offs (15 min)\\n   - Jordan to summarize implementation details for core feature (MOB-101).\\n   - Discuss:\\n     - Cache behavior under low storage / offline conditions.\\n     - Memory footprint implications on older devices.\\n     - Edge cases around image prefetching and fallback formats.\\n   - Capture any items that *must* be deferred beyond the first public launch.\\n\\n4) Rollout path & Planning milestone alignment (8 min)\\n   - Confirm what can confidently ship for the first public launch.\\n   - Align on split between:\\n     - Must‑haves for initial release.\\n     - Nice‑to‑haves for follow‑on releases.\\n   - Identify metrics we’ll track in the first few weeks post‑launch.\\n\\n5) Next steps & owners (2 min)\\n   - Agree on action items and owners (Alex, Jordan, Sam).\\n   - Confirm how updates will be reflected in the MOB roadmap and Jira (e.g., MOB-101 follow‑ups).\\n\\nNotes for Alex (prep)\\n- Make sure the latest version of the dev benchmarks sheet is linked in the calendar invite.\\n- Pull a one‑page view of the performance & growth snapshot to mention in the meeting (no deep dive needed).\\n- Be ready to point back to this doc when sending the final calendar invite so everyone sees the agenda upfront.\"\n

Benchmarks (Week of 2025-11-03)\\\" (spreadsheet)\\n- Context metrics: \\\"MOB – Performance & Growth Snapshot (Week of 2025-11-03)\\\" (dashboard export)\\n\\n1) Context setting\\n- Alex recapped Planning milestone (2025-11-10) and how today’s discussion feeds into finalizing scope for MOB-101 and related items.\\n- Beta metrics show ~10% WoW growth in active users and fewer responsiveness complaints, which aligns with the benchmarked performance gains.\\n\\n2) Review of dev-branch benchmarks\\n- Confirmed ~15% improvement in median cold start time (2400 ms → ~2040 ms) across the main device set.\\n- Jordan highlighted that most of the improvement comes from:\\n  - Reduced image payloads via WebP + adaptive quality.\\n  - Higher cache hit rates on repeat sessions.\\n- Remaining pain points:\\n  - Some low‑memory Android devices still show GC spikes when switching tabs quickly.\\n  - On very poor networks, image placeholders occasionally linger longer than expected.\\n\\n3) Engineering constraints & trade‑offs (MOB-101)\\n- Jordan confirmed the following constraints for the initial launch:\\n  - Cache eviction: will use a simple LRU strategy tuned conservatively for low storage; more sophisticated heuristics will have to wait for a follow‑up.\\n  - Offline behavior: the current implementation prioritizes stability over aggressive prefetching; no time to implement smarter offline-first heuristics before launch.\\n  - Image formats: core WebP path is stable; fallback paths for a few legacy devices are more brittle but acceptable for v1.\\n- Sam agreed these constraints are reasonable for the first public launch as long as we:\\n  - Monitor crash rates and ANR metrics by device tier.\\n  - Track cache hit rate and image error metrics in the first few weeks post‑launch.\\n\\n4) Rollout path & Planning alignment\\n- Consensus on what ships in the initial launch:\\n  - New caching layer enabled by default for all supported devices.\\n  - Image optimization pipeline (WebP + adaptive quality) enabled, with conservative quality floors.\\n- Items explicitly deferred beyond initial launch:\\n  - Advanced cache eviction policies tuned per device/storage profile.\\n  - Smarter offline-first behavior (prefetch rules based on usage patterns).\\n  - UI polish items related to skeleton states for image loading.\\n- Alex will reflect these decisions in the MOB roadmap and update the Planning milestone summary.\\n\\n5) Decisions & action items\\nDecisions\\n- Treat current performance profile as acceptable baseline for launch, contingent on no regressions in the remaining test passes.\\n- MOB-101 will close once:\\n  - Remaining low‑memory device GC spikes are under a defined threshold.\\n  - Performance regression tests are green for two consecutive nightly runs.\\n\\nAction items\\n- Alex: Update MOB roadmap and attach a link to these notes + the dev benchmarks sheet before EOD 2025-11-13.\\n- Jordan: File follow‑up Jira tasks for post‑launch improvements (cache heuristics, offline behavior, skeleton UI).\\n- Sam: Coordinate with Data/Analytics to ensure cache and image metrics are wired into the post‑launch dashboard.\\n\\nSummary for weekly reporting\\n- Performance work is tracking to plan with ~15% improvement in median cold start time.\\n- Launch scope for caching and image optimization is locked; advanced tuning moved to post‑launch iterations.\\n- No blocking Engineering constraints identified for the Planning milestone; remaining items are risk‑tracked but manageable.\"\n    },\n    {\n

2025-11-07 17:18 ET\\n\\nHi all,\\n\\nHere’s a quick summary of this week’s progress on the Mobile App Launch (MOB):\\n\\n1) Performance Improvements\\n- We landed a round of optimizations on the mobile client around image handling and caching.\\n- In our latest benchmark runs on the dev branch, median app start time has improved by roughly 15% compared to last week’s baseline.\\n- Scroll performance on content-heavy views is also noticeably smoother on lower-end devices in our test set.\\n\\n2) User Growth Signals\\n- On the existing beta channel, we’ve seen early positive indicators from the last incremental rollout.\\n- Active beta users are up by a little over 10% week-over-week, and session length continues to trend up.\\n- Support tickets related to app responsiveness have ticked down slightly, which aligns with the performance gains.\\n\\n3) Next Steps\\n- We’ve scheduled a dedicated planning and performance deep-dive session with Engineering next week to finalize constraints and scope before the Planning milestone.\\n- After that session, we’ll update the MOB roadmap and confirm which items make the cut for the first public launch.\\n\\nThanks to everyone who contributed to this week’s work, especially the Engineering team for turning around the performance changes so quickly.\\n\\nBest,\\nAlex\\nPM, R&D\\n\\nReferences\\n- Performance & growth data:
