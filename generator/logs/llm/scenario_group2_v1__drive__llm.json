Next steps\\n- Fold these learnings into the upcoming Planning sync on Nov 13.\\n- Use performance gains to justify more ambitious UX polish in the next sprint.\",\n            \"comments\": []\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          \"event_id\": \"weekly_report_email_1\",\n          \"source\": \"email\",\n          \"timestamp\": \"2025-11-07T16:02:00-05:00\",\n          \"actor\": \"person_alex_smith\",\n          \"description\": \"Alex sends the weekly report email to stakeholders, summarizing performance improvements and user growth, rounded to simple percentages.\",\n          \"data\": {\n            \"message_id\": \"msg_mob_weekly_report_2025_11_07\",\n            \"thread_id\": \"thread_mob_weekly_report_2025_11_07\",\n            \"from\": \"alex.smith@company.com\",\n            \"to\": [\n              \"taylor.brown@company.com\"\n            ],\n            \"cc\": [\n              \"jordan.johnson@company.com\",\n              \"sam.williams@company.com\"\n            ],\n            \"subject\": \"MOB Weekly Update - Week of Nov 3\",\n            \"body\": \"Hi Taylor,\\n\\nHere’s a quick summary for the Mobile App Launch (MOB) this week:\\n\\n1) Performance\\n- Sam completed a focused optimization pass on the core feature (MOB-101).\\n- Early numbers on staging show roughly a 15% improvement in cold start time and a bit over 10% reduction in CPU usage on mid-tier Android devices.\\n\\n2) Users & growth\\n- Per the analytics snapshot this morning, weekly active users and new signups are both up around 10% week-over-week.\\n- Crash-free sessions are holding steady at about 99%.\\n\\nThese are early but encouraging signals as we head into the Planning milestone.
