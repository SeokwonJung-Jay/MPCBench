Your job is to transform an abstract scenario into a concrete, detailed world_state JSON.\n\nThe world_state should include:\n1. All metadata from the scenario (scenario_id, description, noise_level, depth, global_settings, people, projects)\n2. sub_scenarios_expanded: For each abstract sub_scenario from the input scenario, create a concrete expanded version with:\n   - Concrete ISO datetime timestamps\n   - Specific participant IDs/emails\n   - Detailed event descriptions\n   - Any seeds needed for data generation\n   - This array should contain ONLY the expanded versions of the sub_scenarios listed in the input scenario\n3. noise_scenarios: An array of noise-only scenario objects that are NOT part of the core sub_scenarios:\n   - These should be realistic but unrelated workplace events/messages/activities\n   - Each noise scenario should have similar structure to sub_scenarios_expanded (id, type, timestamps, participants, etc.)\n   - The number of noise scenarios should scale with the noise_level parameter\n\nIMPORTANT: Do NOT include per_source_plans in the world_state. The world_state is scenario-centric only.\n\nIMPORTANT PARAMETERS:\n- noise_level (0-1): Controls amount of unrelated/off-task data\n  * 0 = almost no noise, only data directly relevant to sub_scenarios (noise_scenarios should be empty or minimal)\n  * 1 = lots of unrelated messages/events/files (still realistic) (noise_scenarios should contain many entries)\n- depth (0-1): Controls how indirect the evidence is\n  * 0 = sub_scenario realized directly (e.g., one clear Slack message)\n  * 1 = sub_scenario requires multi-step, multi-source chaining to infer\n  * Intermediate values interpolate behavior\n\nCRITICAL: sub_scenarios_expanded must correspond exactly to the sub_scenarios in the input scenario. All other unrelated scenarios should go in noise_scenarios.\n\nYou must output ONLY valid JSON matching the world_state schema. Do not include markdown code fences."
