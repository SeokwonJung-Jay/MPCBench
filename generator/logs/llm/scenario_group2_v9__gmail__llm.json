quick summary of this week’s progress on the Mobile App Launch (MOB):\\n\\n1) Performance Improvements\\n- We landed a round of optimizations on the mobile client around image handling and caching.\\n- In our latest benchmark runs on the dev branch, median app start time has improved by roughly 15% compared to last week’s baseline.\\n- Scroll performance on content-heavy views is also noticeably smoother on lower-end devices in our test set.\\n\\n2) User Growth Signals\\n- On the existing beta channel, we’ve seen early positive indicators from the last incremental rollout.\\n- Active beta users are up by a little over 10% week-over-week, and session length continues to trend up.\\n- Support tickets related to app responsiveness have ticked down slightly, which aligns with the performance gains.\\n\\n3) Next Steps\\n- We’ve scheduled a dedicated planning and performance deep-dive session with Engineering next week to finalize constraints and scope before the Planning milestone.\\n- After that session, we’ll update the MOB roadmap and confirm which items make the cut for the first public launch.\\n\\nThanks to everyone who contributed to this week’s work, especially the Engineering team for turning around the performance changes so quickly.\\n\\nBest,\\nAlex\\nPM, R&D\",\n        \"recipients_groups\": [\n          \"R&D\",\n          \"Engineering
