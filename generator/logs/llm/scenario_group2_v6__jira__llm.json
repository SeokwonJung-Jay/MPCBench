beta results look stable; we’ll continue to expand the rollout next week.\\n\\n2) User growth\\n- Between the performance work and the omnichannel promo, weekly active users are up ~10% week over week.\\n- Early retention numbers for the new cohort also look promising (details in the dashboard).\\n\\n3) Launch readiness\\n- MOB-100 (Initial Setup) is fully wrapped.\\n- MOB-101 (Core Feature)

networking tweaks, we’re seeing about a 15% improvement in average app start time across the monitored cohort.\\n- In addition to the faster start, p95 feed load times are down noticeably, which should translate to a smoother first-use experience.\\n\\n2) User growth\\n- Weekly active users on the mobile app are up roughly 10% week over week.\\n- A combination of the performance work and the Nov promo campaign seems to be driving better engagement, especially on first and second sessions.\\n\\n3) Launch readiness\\n- MOB-100 (Mobile App Launch – Initial Setup) is complete.\\n- MOB-101 (Mobile App Launch – Core Feature) is in progress and on track for the current milestone.\\n\\nWe’ll use next week’s planning session to lock in the remaining work needed for the November 30
