Each event shows whether a specific person is busy or free at a given time slot.\n\nUse cases:\n- When finding meeting times, you need to check each participant's calendar to see their availability. Listing events helps you understand individual schedules before calculating common free slots.\n- Events with busy=true indicate time slots when a person is unavailable. Events with busy=false show when they are free.\n- If you need to understand why certain time slots are unavailable, inspecting individual events can reveal specific conflicts or commitments.\n\nExample: calendar_list_events(email_addresses=['alice@example.com'], start_date='2025-12-01') to see Alice's events for December 1st. After listing events, you can call calendar_query_freebusy() to find common free slots across multiple participants.\n\nImportant: The calendar data may not include all scheduling constraints.

Each time slot indicates when all specified email addresses are free.\n\nUse cases:\n- When scheduling meetings with multiple participants, this function finds time slots when everyone is available simultaneously.\n- The returned time_slots show only periods where all specified participants have busy=false in their calendars.\n- If a task requires finding a meeting time that works for multiple people, this is typically the most efficient approach.\n- You can call this directly without first listing events, or use calendar_list_events() first if you need to inspect individual schedules.\n\nExample: calendar_query_freebusy(email_addresses=['alice@example.com', 'bob@example.com'], start_date='2025-12-01', end_date='2025-12-07') to find common free slots for Alice and Bob during the first week of December.\n\nImportant: The calendar data may not include all scheduling constraints.

Threads with subjects like 'Schedule update', 'Meeting time change', or 'Availability update' may contain relevant information.\n- When team members communicate about meeting times via email, these conversations are preserved in threads. Searching for keywords related to scheduling can help you find relevant email discussions.\n- If a task involves checking for cancellations or changes to previously scheduled meetings, email threads are a common place where such information appears.\n- After finding a relevant thread, use gmail_get_thread() to read all messages in the conversation.\n\nExample: gmail_list_threads(query='meeting') to find threads containing 'meeting', or gmail_list_threads(query='cancel') to find cancellation-related threads."
